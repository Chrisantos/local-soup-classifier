# local-soup-classifier
In this project, I worked on developing a deep learning model that is able to classify 4 different African local soups with an accuracy of 90% using PyTorch.  

The dataset was prepared by downloading different images of the 4 classes of soup from the internet. I used two approaches; a pre-trained model and fine-tuned the model, and training the model from scratch.
